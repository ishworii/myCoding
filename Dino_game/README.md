I built this game to lure my nephew into programming.
This game is similar to the dinasour game in chrome.
I have implemented simple speech recognition and the unicorn jumps
after hearing 'up'  from user. Although it has alot of issues and needs
more work,but still this is close to me.
Credits to Daniel Shiffmann for the youtube video which i followed along.
